### 2. Search in rotated sorted array in O(logn)

1. Find the pivot --> Like a binary search, but taking left or right based on other conditions, takes O(logn)
2. with the pivot we can cut the array pivot to left, pivot to right O(1)
3. apply binary search to this portion O(logn)


* Time O(logn + 1 + logn) ----> O(logn)
* Space O(logn) --> the recursive stack of binary search
