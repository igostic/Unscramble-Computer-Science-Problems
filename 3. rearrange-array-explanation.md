### 3. Re arrange array digits
Pattern is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 --> give us 5, 3, 1 and 4, 2
- Is basically a sorted array reversed
- iterate over array popping the first item
- append one to result1 and the next one to result2

* Time complexity expected --> O(nlogn) --> Just sort it and then apply the pattern iterating the array in reverse
* Space complexity --> quicksort recursive stack O(logn)
