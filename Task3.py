# TASK 3:
# (080) is the area code for fixed line telephones in Bangalore.
# Fixed line numbers include parentheses, so Bangalore numbers
# have the form (080)xxxxxxx.)

# Part A: Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people
# in Bangalore.
#  - Fixed lines start with an area code enclosed in brackets. The area
#    codes vary in length but always begin with 0.
#  - Mobile numbers have no parentheses, but have a space in the middle
#    of the number to help readability. The prefix of a mobile number
#    is its first four digits, and they always start with 7, 8 or 9.
#  - Telemarketers' numbers have no parentheses or space, but they start
#    with the area code 140.

# Print the answer as part of a message:
# "The numbers called by people in Bangalore have codes:"
#  <list of codes>
# The list of codes should be print out one per line in lexicographic order with no duplicates.

# Part B: What percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are made
# to fixed lines also in Bangalore? In other words, of all the calls made
# from a number starting with "(080)", what percentage of these calls
# were made to a number also starting with "(080)"?

# Print the answer as a part of a message::
# "<percentage> percent of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are calls
# to other fixed lines in Bangalore."
# The percentage should have 2 decimal digits

# PART A
